Within the old technology, there were separate individuals who programmed the animatronics from those who animated on screen characters. This disparity was created by the technical knowledge of the machines. A consequence, however, was that the animatronics often looked robotic and linear, bereft of the illusion of life. Modern technology allows professional animators to imbue their characters with life regardless of whether they are on a screen or composed of complex robotics. The same software can be used to make them both alive.
